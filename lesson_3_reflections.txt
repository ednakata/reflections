When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others.  When working from multiple machines.
    To have an offsite repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may be working on items locally and you don't want to have your
    changes stomped on by pulling the remote files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are when you want to take existing code and start making revisions,
    but you want to label the point when they separated.  Clones are copies of a 
    repository (including commits).  Forks are when you clone a repository strictly
    within GitHub and they are then linked so that you know what the source was.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can then work with the files offline to do diffs

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be easier to make sure that I have the recent committed code from 
    other people (and vice versa).  However, keeping on top of the changes may be 
    difficult.  Doing reviews would be easier as well.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
